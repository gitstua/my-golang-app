This is a basic structure for a Go application.

## Project Structure

- `cmd/main.go`: This is the main entry point of the application.
- `pkg`: This directory is intended to hold the libraries and packages that can be used by other applications.
- `internal`: This directory is intended to hold packages that should only be used by the application itself.
- `api`: This directory is used to hold all the API related code.
- `web`: This directory is used to hold all the web server related code.
- `scripts`: This directory is used to hold scripts like database migration scripts, build scripts, etc.
- `.gitignore`: This file is used to tell git which files or directories to ignore in the project.
- `go.mod`: This file is used by Go's dependency management system.
